#DMV Metro Map
Final project for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. 

This is a map of all of the Metro stations in the DMV area. Stations will be searchable by name or line. Station data was pulled from WMATA API.

This project is still actively being working on. A live version can be found at [leogenerali.com/metro-map](http://www.leogenerali.com/metro-map/).
